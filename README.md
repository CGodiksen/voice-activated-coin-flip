# Voice activated coin flip
Simple console program that uses speech recognition to flip a coin and determine a winner. The program uses Microsoft Azure speech recognition which means an Azure
subscription is neccesary to run the program. 

Simply say "Heads" or "Tails" to pick the side of the coin that you want and the program will flip the coin. Saying "Stop" stops the program.
